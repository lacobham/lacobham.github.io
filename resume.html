<h4 id="sanddune">Sand Dune Mapping with GPS</h4>

<p>My most recent work experience was in the summer of 2023, when I worked with a team of Laurier professors and other students as a research assistant. I helped collect GPS data that would inform action on sand dune restoration at Burlington Beach and Wasaga Beach.</p>

<h4 id="data">Data Collection Locations</h4>

<p>First, the team went to Burlington Beach in early June of 2022, spending the day there and learning how to use the Leica S16 rover. Then, in late June the team went to Wasaga Beach, where the data collection could go faster due to the students being more experienced with the equipment. It took approximately 2 hours to get to Wasaga Beach, and only took 15 to reach Burlington Beach.</p>
