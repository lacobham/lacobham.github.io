<p>After starting at Wilfrid Laurier University in September 2019 with my major being undecided, I took courses from every arts program, deciding to pursue Geography at the end of my first year because of a great professor I had.</p>
<p>I graduated with high distinction, meaning I had a cumulative GPA of over 11.0 for all of my courses. I was also able to earn the Esri Canada GIS Scholarship in my 4th year, which involved making a poster summarizing a research project that I did. More information about that can be found on the 'Work Experience' tab under 'Sand Dune Mapping with GPS.' Laurier's Waterloo campus is located in Waterloo, Ontario, but there are also campuses in Brantford and Toronto.</p>
<p>At Laurier I took introductory courses to topics I'm currently learning more about like remote sensing, geovisualization, and surveying as well as many human geography courses. </p>
